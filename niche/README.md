# Niche Scripts
These scripts are very niche and thus not in the main part of the repository.

# Artifact Hunter
Randomly zooms in and crops a random part of a random frame from a video and exports it as an image.

# Audio Sync
Tries to sync audio with a video. By default, the program finds a version of the input file not ending in ` - blur` as I use it for that program, but that can be easily changed. If no file is found automatically, it will ask for one.

# Cape Padder
Adds padding to a minecraft cape texture that isn't properly formatted.

# Mask Blur
Masks a video made with https://github.com/f0e/blur, covering artifacts. Designed for Minecraft. This is just proof of concept, and **is not made to look good**.

# Minecraft Pack Checker
Checks if selected (unzipped) texture packs contain a pack.png and pack.mcmeta file, logging those that don't. If the pack has a pack.png with a resolution above 64x64, it is downscaled to 64x64.

# Remove Cape Corners
Removes (makes transparent) the corners of a Minecraft cape that doesn't have transparent corners.

# Upscale NN
Scales a file with nearest neighbor. This works with images, videos, gifs, etc. It's planned to add more algorithms in the future.

# Video Comparer (Abandoned)
Horizontally stacks videos together for comparisons. Requires at least 2 inputs but can take many more.

# WebM Scaling
Makes a WebM file with a variable resolution, creating an "bouncing" effect.
