# Niche Scripts
These scripts are very niche and thus not in the main part of the repository.

# Cape Padder
Adds padding to a minecraft cape texture that isn't properly formatted.

# Mask Blur
Masks a video made with https://github.com/f0e/blur, covering artifacts. Designed for Minecraft. This is just proof of concept, and **is not made to look good**.

# Minecraft Pack Checker
Checks if selected (unzipped) texture packs contain a pack.png and pack.mcmeta file, logging those that don't. If the pack has a pack.png with a resolution above 64x64, it is downscaled to 64x64.

# Remove Cape Corners
Removes (makes transparent) the corners of a Minecraft cape that doesn't have transparent corners.
