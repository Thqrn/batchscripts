# What is this?
This is a collection of scripts I've made or am still making. Most, if not all, require FFmpeg. They all use drag and drop features, which means you can also use them in send-to. If you need any help add me on discord, Frost#5872, or join my server, https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz

# Support
As mentioned, for support either join the discord (https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz) or contact me directly on discord, Frost#5872.

# Add Text
Essentially a meme generator. Allows a user to add top text and bottom text.

# Audio Sync
Syncs audio with a video. By default, the program finds a version of the input file not ending in ` - blur` as I use it for that program, but that can be easily changed. If no file is found automatically, it will ask for one.

# Change FPS
Changes the fps of a video.

# Change Speed
Changes the speed of a video.

# Extract Frame
Extracts a frame from a video. Note that frames start at 0, so the second frame in the video is 1, the third is 2, and so on.

# Interpolater
Interpolates a video. It should be noted that, in most cases, this looks like complete shit.

# Metadata
Extracts some metadata from a file.

# Replace Audio
Allows you to replace the audio in a video with audio from another source.

# Upscale NN
Upscales a media file with nearest neighbor. This works with images, videos, gifs, etc.
