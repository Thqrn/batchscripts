# What is this?
This is a collection of batch script's I've made or am still making. Most require on FFmpeg, you'll need that to use them. They all use drag and drop features, which means you can also use them in send-to. If you need any help add me on discord, Frost#5872, or join my server, https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz

# Support
As mentioned, for support either join the discord (https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz) or contact me directly on discord, Frost#5872.

# Change Speed

# Interpolater

# Replace Audio
Rllows you to replace the audio in a video with audio from another source.

# Blur Auto Audio Fix
For use with https://github.com/f0e/blur

Blur has an issue for me where it slightly slows down the output video so audio is ever so slightly off sync. This script tries to fix that. When you send a file to it, it will try to find the original, non-blur file and match the audio with the output from blur. Does not support automatic finding if you use detailed filenames, but the script itself does still work (you just have to drag in the original video manually).

# Add Text

# Change FPS
Changes the fps of a video.
